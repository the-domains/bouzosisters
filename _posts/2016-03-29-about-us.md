ABOUT US

Noura and Basma Bouzo are the co-founders, owners and directors of Oasis Magazine, Saudi Design Week, and the O Design Incubator. 

Although the sisters both graduated from widely different fields - Noura with  a Bachelors degree in Fine Arts and a Masters in Art History and Basma with a Bachelors and Masters in Biology and Immunology from the University of Oxford - they both fell in love with publishing and were soon running Oasis Magazine which was founded by their mother, Munira Al Ajlani. 

Through Oasis Magazine, the sisters created a dynamic platform and the only arts and culture magazine based in Saudi Arabia. They soon expanded this platform to incorporate events that exposed talented emerging artists and designers. Saudi Design Week is the latest and most sought after annual event that the sisters have created giving the region a new hub for design and Saudi designers a louder voice and bigger stage to highlight their talent.

The sisters have recently created a design collective to help enrich the design scene and have created a series of installations including one that examined the notion of the copy/paste syndrome quite common in the art and design world, using Jeff Koons as a reference point in their installation dubbed Al Maha Balloon ( Oryx Balloon) .
