The 'Balloon Oryx' created with the support of  The King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture, A Saudi Aramco Initiative 

The Bouzo Sisters wanted to open a dialogue of interpretation with the audience within the context of the copy/paste syndrome in contemporary art and, by extension, consumerism, they created the "Balloon Oryx" modeled after American artist Jeff Koons' famous "Balloon Dog" sculpture. The original one-ton metal Koons balloon animal conveys an illusion of weightlessness and marked a new pinnacle of sculpture as medium, discipline and tradition.

There is a common misconception that you can avoid infringement by making at least 20% changes from the original. This is untrue. Infringement is not a mathematical formula!

In their work, Noura and Basma have taken it upon themselves to test this equation. They reconstructed the sculpture within a new cultural context by choosing the oryx (almaha), as a nod to the Arabian Peninsula. Within these new conditions does the sculpture still make sense? Have enough changes been made for the sculpture to be considered an original piece?

Koons, and other famous artists such as Damien Hirst, have all been accused of plagiarism. Where do we draw the line between plagiarism and influence, between inspiration and imitation?
